# TodoXpress

TodoXpress is a full-stack Todo list application built with React, Node.js (Express), and MongoDB. It allows users to manage their todo items with a simple and intuitive user interface.

## Features

- Add new todos to the list
- View existing todos
- Mark todos as completed

## Why TodoXpress?

The primary objective behind building TodoXpress is to gain practical confidence in two essential aspects of modern web development:

1. Cypress and React Testing: TodoXpress demonstrates the implementation of end-to-end testing using Cypress for a React application. By building and testing a full-stack Todo list application, you will gain hands-on experience in writing effective end-to-end tests that simulate user interactions and ensure the application's correct behavior from a user's perspective.

2. TypeScript in Web Development: TodoXpress utilizes TypeScript in both the frontend (React) and the backend (Node.js with Express). TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch type-related errors early in the development process. By working with TypeScript in TodoXpress, you will learn how to build robust web applications with strong typing, interfaces, and type annotations, resulting in improved code quality and reduced errors.

Through this project, you will not only have a functional Todo list application but also develop practical experience in Cypress for React testing and TypeScript for building more reliable web applications. The knowledge gained from TodoXpress will make you a more proficient and confident web developer, capable of delivering high-quality software solutions.
